    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

In the real world, ideally your base model would be either the results of a previous model or could be based on a research paper upon which you are looking to improve. When there is no benchmark model set, getting a result better than random choice is a place you could start from.\n",

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "\n",
    "Gaussian Naive Bayes:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Real world application:\n",
    "        - To mark spam emails\n",
    "    Strengths:\n",
    "        - Besides being simple yet powerful model, it performs well at predicting classes.\n",
    "        - When we have independent and categorical features, it performs well with less data.\n",
    "    Weaknesses:\n",
    "        - Naive Bayes assumes features to be independent but this may not always be true.\n",
    "        - It's hard to apply it to continuous variables, even though we can categorize continuous variables while doing that we may lose some useful information.\n",
    "    What makes it good for this problem:\n",
    "        - Naive Bayes is a simple and effective algorithm which makes probabilistic predictions using categorical data. Since most of our features were categorized and it seems relatively easy to categorize our continuous features for this problem (e.g. we can recode variables into quartiles) Naive Bayes is a good candidate for this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Real world application:\n",
    "        - Whether a user will buy a product or not\n",
    "    Strengths:\n",
    "        - It is helpful to understand the influence of independent variables on the outcome. \n",
    "        - Features can be discrete and/or continuous\n",
    "    Weaknesses:\n",
    "        - It is not great at understanding complex relationships between features.\n",
    "        - It can't predict continuous outcomes.\n",
    "        - If there are related features, algorithm will calculate the influence of those features more than the others.\n",
    "    What makes it good for this problem:\n",
    "        - Logistic Regression is used to determine binary outputs based on the effect of multiple independent variables on the dependent variable. This is basically what we are trying to accomplish in this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Support Vector Machine:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Real world application:\n",
    "        - Hand-writing recognition\n",
    "    Strengths:\n",
    "        - Using a non-linear kernel we can capture complex relationships between features.\n",
    "        - Works well with high dimensional data.\n",
    "        - It tries to maximize the margin which makes our model more robust.\n",
    "    Weaknesses:\n",
    "        - Training time might be really long if we use a complex model.\n",
    "        - In large datasets with so much noise data, SVM might prone to overfit on noise data.\n",
    "        - It may be hard to come up with a good kernel function.\n",
    "    What makes it good for this problem:\n",
    "        - Support vector machine algorithm can be used for binary classification problems. Even though we are not able to find a linear line to perfectly classify the points, we can use C parameter and kernels to have more options to separate the data. For this problem, since we have many features we probably won't be able to separate the data just with a single line so using the tricks I mentioned above might be helpful for this problem. Also SVM expects for numeric inputs but we can easily transform our categorical features to  binary variables to overcome this problem."

If our features are height and weight, algorithm estimates how much height and weight separately influence someone being male or female using minimization and optimization techniques. We can think these techniques like we're trying to minimize the error by setting up new coefficients for our features so we can see how much they affect the end result and we can come up with correct coefficients. After it comes up with coefficients for features, it calculates the result using new data and transforms this result into binary using a special function to make a classification."

    "There are two different features than my list, these are capital-gain and capital-loss. It totally makes sense for these features to have big influence on income. I didn't include these features because when I checked the data I saw most of the data for these features was 0 so I thought including these features wouldn't have a big influence on income since they're mostly zeros. This plot shows that even if data is mostly zero for a feature, it can have a big impact on the outcome result. To clarify, we can pick random people with capital-gain and loss and see how much they make. If we see a strong pattern we can say that these features still might be helpful although they are mostl zero. What I learned from this plot is not to ignore features even though they're mostly zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other than this, results are similar to my answer. Only surprising thing for me was that we don't see occupation in the plot. I thought some specific occupations would have higher income and some have lower so this would be a good distinguishing feature. But from the plot we can see that education is more important than occupation. It's because of higher education leads to occupations with higher salaries. Also age and hours-per-week are more important than occupation and I think it's because of even though if someone's occupation doesn't pay a lot in general, along their career they'll make more or they can work at 2 jobs with lower salaries and still make more than 50K a year."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
