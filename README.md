# Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree
Projects of Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree Program

These are the projects I've completed so far.

[Titanic Survival Exploration](https://github.com/sbsomuncuoglu/udacity-machine-learning-nanodegree/tree/master/titanic-survival-exploration)

Created decision functions that attempt to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster based on each passenger's features, such as sex and age.

[Predicting Boston Housing Prices](https://github.com/sbsomuncuoglu/udacity-machine-learning-nanodegree/tree/master/predicting-boston-housing-prices)

Applied basic machine learning techniques using NumPy and Scikit-Learn. Introduction to concepts such as training & testing sets, bias & variance, grid search, cross-validation, decision trees and regression algorithms.

[Finding Donors](https://github.com/sbsomuncuoglu/udacity-machine-learning-nanodegree/tree/master/finding-donors) 

Applied supervised learning techniques such as Gaussian Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine on data. Also applied a series of transformations and preprocessing techniques to manipulate the data into a workable format and optimized the model.
